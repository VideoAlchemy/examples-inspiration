####[Algorithmic Animation (Algo) / parsons 2010 / Zachary Lieberman](http://teaching.thesystemis.com/classes/algo/?cat=4) (openFrameworks) 

______________

- wk02:  interpolation, powf to shape, xeno
- wk03:  sin / cos code, point recording, lisajous, multiple circles, and atan2
	- make a composition using the animation techniques that is a tribute to john whitney.
		- [John Whitney "Catalog" 1961](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbV7loKp69s)
		- [John Whitney - Arabesque (1975) early computer graphics](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7h0ppnUQhE)
	- sin and cos to emulate a natural phenomenon
	- extend the xeno / atan2 code, making a creature which follows the mouse.
	- since we talked about amplitude modulation in relationship to sin/cos animation, see if you can implement visual equivalents of other synthesis techniques, such as FM synthesis (modulating the carrier frequency) or additive synthesis.
- wk04:  recoding gesture + time, and creating timed playback
- wk05:  individual particles, multiple particles, drawing with particles and bounce of the walls
- wk06:  vector fields + particles, and some basic particle attraction / repulsion from a point code
- wk07:  particle particle interaction code
- wk10:  faster particle particle interaction code.
- wk11:  flocking and springs
- wk12:  noise (via a texture) and applying noise to particles. 
- wk13:  using a pointer to share objects (a font) between particles; scenes / baseScene:
- wk14:  intro to ofxBox2d, ofxBox2d + vector field
